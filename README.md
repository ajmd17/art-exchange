art-exchange.io uses blockchain to give physical properties to digital works of art

By issuing works of digital art on the blockchain, we can make art pieces *rare*.
In the same way that there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins, art-exchange.io allows you to issue only 1000, 100, 10, or just a single copy of that piece to exist in the digital form.

The site features a trading interface that allows users to exchange their ownership over works of art with *ARTX* tokens which may then be cashed out for ethereum (or something similar), used to purchase ownership of other artwork, or participate in crowd-funding via *initial art offerings*.
