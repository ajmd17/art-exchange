# art-exchange.io - The Art of Blockchain
art-exchange.io uses blockchain to give physical properties to digital works of art

By issuing works of digital art on the blockchain, we can make art pieces *rare*.
In the same way that there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins, art-exchange.io allows you to issue only 1000, 100, 10, or just a single copy of that piece to exist in the digital form.

The site features a trading interface that allows users to exchange their ownership over works of art with *ARTX* tokens which may then be cashed out for ethereum (or something similar), used to purchase ownership of other artwork, or participate in crowd-funding via *initial art offerings*.


### The ARTX Token

The ARTX token powers the decentralized exchanging of artwork on the blockchain.
art-exchange.io plans to initially get the token into the hands (wallets?) of users via tiered airdrop. Those who do more to help spread word on the project and raise awareness before the beta launch will be given higher token rewards.

The first 500 sign-ups will receive 500 ARTX individually.
A sale token-sale to provide funding for the platform may be an option, as well.
